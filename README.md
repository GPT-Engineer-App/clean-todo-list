A simple todo application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. The interface should be clean and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability. Features include a list view of tasks, buttons for editing and deleting tasks, and the ability to mark tasks as completed. The color scheme is light with primary colors like blue and green for buttons and interactive elements, while maintaining a minimalistic design.
